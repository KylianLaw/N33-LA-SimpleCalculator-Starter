Ilian Adeleke:  The first push was to change the converstion class (string to int) to be static which was change 1.(We also added a comment line just as a test)

Ava Key: Moved the “CalculatorEngine” class into its own project, created a DLL out of it, and added it to our main project which was change 4

Ilian Adeleke: Completed the first part of part 2 which was to make the program ask for the input again in case the input was not a 
number (if the user entered “six” or “cat” for example, and not “6”)

Everyone: We had a huge syncronizing issue and we had to merge everything to getter in other to re-establish stability

Isaac Nachate: Implemented the calcEngine that contained the calculate method. For this method, each operation type had multiple switch case statement to make sure the program would 
recognize different symboles or input and know that they were all applying to the same operation (e.g. Add, plus, +)

Isaac Nachate : Implemented the InputConverter with the ConvertToInputNumeric method and the ValidOperation method. For the ConvertToInputNumeric 
we also included a out boolean value to make sure the program would keep asking for input as long as the entered value would be judged invalid (Ilian 
Adeleke also helped with this one).

Ilian Adeleke:  added some missing case to the calculate method in CalcEngine

Ilian Adeleke: fixed the string formatting for the result in the main program(Change 3)

Ava Key: Add an additional function to the calculate class which is the factorial method (Change 5)

Ilian Adeleke: Made all test cases for InputConverter and CalcEngine in the SimpleCalculatorTest.Unit
